    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole turkey (12-14 pounds)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter (softened)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh sage (chopped)</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 onion (quartered)</li>
        <li>2 carrots (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C).</li>
        <li>Remove giblets from turkey cavity and pat the turkey dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix softened butter, salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, sage, and minced garlic.</li>
        <li>Gently loosen the skin of the turkey and spread half of the butter mixture under the skin. Rub the remaining butter mixture all over the outside of the turkey.</li>
        <li>Place onion, carrots, and celery in the bottom of a roasting pan. Place the turkey on a rack above the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and tuck the wing tips under the body.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Roast the turkey in the preheated oven, basting every 30 minutes with pan juices. Roast for about 13-15 minutes per pound, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165°F (74°C).</li>
        <li>Remove turkey from oven and let it rest for 20-30 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.</li>
        <li>Carve and serve with your favorite sides. Enjoy!</li>
